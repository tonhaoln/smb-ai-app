# **Problem**

# Raw

Perfect catch — and this is the refinement that changes everything.

You’re right:

- ***They**

**are**

**willing to use AI…**

…but they don’t want to figure out HOW to use AI.**

They want the result, not the prompting skill.

Let’s sharpen the problem with that nuance:

# **Refined Core Problem (Much Closer to Reality)**

# Small business owners are willing to use AI, but they’re wasting time because they don’t know how to get the right results. They keep copying things into ChatGPT without knowing what to ask — so the output is generic, inconsistent, or wrong.

They’re stuck in a loop:

1. “I know AI could help me.”
2. “But I don’t know what to type.”
3. “So I try random prompts.”
4. “It gives me something… kinda useful?”
5. “But I don’t trust it, and it takes forever to tweak.”
6. “Screw it, I’ll write the message myself.”

Your product breaks this cycle.

# **⭐**

# **Even sharper:**

# They want to use AI to handle recurring business situations — but they don’t know how to prompt AI to actually solve those situations.

Boom.

This is the real blocker.

Not lack of AI access.

Not resistance to AI.

Not lack of AI interest.

They don’t know HOW to tell AI what they actually need.

This is the part that has never been solved.

# **⭐**

# **The Real Pain in One Line**

# They know AI can help, but they don’t know what to ask AI to get the outcome they need.

That’s the gap your product bridges.

# **⭐**

# **Your product’s positioning becomes obvious:**

You’re not competing with ChatGPT.

You’re feeding ChatGPT the right instructions.

You’re the missing layer between:

“AI could help me.”

and

“AI actually solves my real business problems.”

# **Refined Problem Statement (Final Cut)**

# Small business owners deal with the same stressful customer situations every week. They want to use AI to handle them — but they don’t know how to prompt AI properly, so they get mediocre results and waste time. They need industry-specific prompts that actually produce the right outcome instantly.

This is the truest form of the problem.

Clean.

Concrete.

Verified by every conversation you’ve had with real operators.

Aligned with your OS vision.

And perfectly suited to a daily-action product.

If this feels right, I’ll consolidate it into the canonical Problem Section (short, sharp, shippable) before we move on to defining the Industry OS.

# Refined

Perfect — here is the canonical, clean, shippable Problem Definition based on everything we uncovered.

This will anchor your product vision, Industry OS, UX, and messaging.

This is the version you keep.

# **📌 Problem Definition (Canonical)**

Small business owners deal with the same stressful customer scenarios every week — cancellations, price objections, scope creep, refund requests, no-shows, quote negotiations, and endless back-and-forth messages.

They want to use AI to handle these moments.

They’re already copying and pasting into ChatGPT.

But they don’t know how to prompt AI properly, so they get:

- generic responses
- wrong tone
- inconsistent quality
- scripts that don’t match their industry
- outputs they spend time fixing
- results they don’t fully trust

They waste time reinventing messages from scratch, or worse, fighting with AI to get usable output.

They don’t need “more AI.”

They need the right prompts that reliably solve the situations they deal with every week — specific to their industry, their context, and their real-world friction.

# **📌 One-Line Version**

# SMBs want to use AI for recurring customer situations, but they don’t know what to ask — so they get mediocre results and waste time.

# **📌 Emotional Version**

# They know AI could save them time —

# but every time a stressful customer message comes in,

# they’re back to staring at a blank screen.

# **📌 Operational Version**

# SMBs need ready-to-use, industry-specific prompts that produce consistent, correct, copy-paste-ready outputs for the real scenarios they face weekly.

# **The core artifact the user will see on the landing page**

**Short answer:**

**Yes – this *is* the core artifact the user will see on the landing page after selecting their industry…
BUT: it’s shown in a *simplified, landing-friendly presentation*.**

Let me break it down cleanly.

---

# ⭐ **What the user sees after selecting their industry**

They do **NOT** see the full Scenario Artifact with every internal piece exposed.

That’s too heavy for landing.

They see a **presentation layer** built *from* that canonical structure.

Think of it this way:

**Canonical Scenario = the engine**

**Landing Display = the UI-friendly card**

Same content, simpler visual.

---

# ⭐ **Landing Page Layout (Post-Industry Selection)**

You’ll show:

1. **Today’s Featured Action** (large card)
2. **3–4 Recent Actions** (medium cards)
3. **“Browse All Actions (Pro)” CTA**

Each card is a *surface-level version* of the canonical scenario.

---

# ⭐ **What each card shows (Landing Version)**

### **1. Title**

“Client asks for discount after seeing your quote”

### **2. Situation sentence**

“When a client tries to negotiate price after receiving your estimate.”

### **3. Action Summary**

“Get a confident, industry-correct response that holds your price and keeps the lead warm.”

### **4. CTA buttons**

**“Copy prompt”**

**“View details”**

When the user taps “View details,”

they see the **full artifact**:

- Make it yours
- Example output
- Business logic-driven solution
- Time saved

The full structure stays consistent,

but the landing only shows a preview.

---

# ⭐ **Why it’s done this way**

Because:

### ✔ The canonical format guarantees output quality

– for creation

– for testing

– for trust

### ✔ The presentation format guarantees UX clarity

– for browsing

– for conversion

– for habit building

SMBs don’t want to read 7 sections per card on the landing.

They want:

**“Is this relevant?”**

**“Does this solve my problem?”**

**“Give me the solution.”**

That’s it.

---

# ⭐ **Correct mental model**

### **The Canonical Scenario = the internal OS artifact**

Consistent.

Testable.

Structured.

OS-level truth.

### **The Landing Scenario Card = the display layer**

Trimmed down.

Fast to scan.

Actionable.

Landing-friendly.

Same info, different packaging.

---

# ⭐ **So yes — what you described IS the OS scenario template.

And the landing shows a simplified version of it.**

Perfect alignment.

If you want, I can now show:

👉 **Landing Page Wireframe**

👉 **Scenario Card UI (full vs preview)**

👉 **Example of 5 landing cards for one industry**

Just say which direction.

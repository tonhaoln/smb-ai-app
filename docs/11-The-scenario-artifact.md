# **The scenario artifact**

If by **“srtifcat”** you mean **the scenario artifact** (the Action card / Scenario unit inside the Industry OS),

then **YES — it must always have the exact same structure.**

This is not optional.

This is one of the core reasons the system works and stays consistent.

---

# ⭐ **Why it must always have the same structure**

Because:

- It keeps the **LLM output stable**
- It keeps **testing repeatable**
- It ensures **predictable UX**
- It prevents hallucinations
- It gives SMBs **trust** (“this always works the same way”)
- It keeps the library clean
- It keeps the OS maintainable
- It enables automated updates later

If the structure drifts → quality collapses.

# ⭐ **The Canonical Scenario Structure (always the same)**

Every scenario must contain these sections:

### **1. Industry Tag + Metadata**

- Industry
- Category
- Difficulty
- Importance

### **2. The Situation (1 sentence)**

A precise trigger, always in the same format.

### **3. The AI Action (benefit-focused)**

What the prompt will *do for them*, not what it *contains*.

### **4. The Copy-Paste Prompt (boxed)**

The actual prompt template, referencing logic blocks.

### **5. “Make it yours” (2–3 customization points)**

Always optional, always the same structure, max 3 bullets.

### **6. What You’ll Get (example output)**

A gold-standard example following the same shape every time.

### **7. Time Saved (optional but consistent)**

Simple numeric value: “~3 min per request.”

# ⭐ **Example of stable structure (always the same):**

```
[Industry Badge]
Day X • 3–5 min • Works with ChatGPT

THE SITUATION:
[1-sentence trigger]

THE AI ACTION:
[Benefit-focused explanation]

COPY & PASTE THIS:
[Prompt box]

MAKE IT YOURS:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

WHAT YOU’LL GET:
[2–3 sentence example output]

TIME SAVED:
~3 min per request

```

This never changes.

Only the *content* changes.

# ⭐ Why this matters for your moat

Your defensibility comes from:

**Consistency → trust → usage → retention → data → stronger OS → more accuracy → more trust.**

The moment you allow scenarios to drift structurally:

- testing breaks
- tone becomes inconsistent
- quality drops
- SMB trust collapses
- OS becomes messy

So yes—

# **The artifact must ALWAYS have the same structure.**

It’s non-negotiable.

If you'd like, I can now define:

👉 **The Canonical Scenario Template (final version)**

so it’s locked in and ready for the OS.

Just say: **“Lock the scenario template.”**

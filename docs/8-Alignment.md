# **Alignment**

Short, sharp, honest answer:

# ***Yes — the “pain-point browser” MVP directly solves the validated problem.**

And it’s the cleanest possible solution to it.**

Let me walk it through cleanly so you can feel it land:

# **Validated Problem Recap**

SMBs:

1. Deal with the same stressful customer scenarios repeatedly
2. Want to use AI to handle them
3. But don’t know how to prompt AI
4. So they get generic or wrong outputs
5. Waste time rewriting or fighting with ChatGPT
6. Lack industry-specific, outcome-stable prompts
7. Need instant, trustworthy, copy-paste solutions

That’s the real-world problem.

# **⭐**

# **What the Pain-Point Browser MVP Does**

Your MVP provides:

- Industry-specific scenarios
- Scenario-level business logic baked in
- A tested prompt that reliably produces the correct output
- Copy-paste ready solutions
- No user prompting required
- One new high-friction scenario per day
- Full library access behind paywall

This removes:

- prompting guesswork
- context-building
- tuning
- uncertainty
- time wasted rewriting
- fear of AI errors
- generic templates
- emotionally-loaded writing from scratch

It gives the SMB owner exactly what they lack:

“Tell me exactly what to paste into ChatGPT to fix this moment.”

Its simplicity is its strength.
